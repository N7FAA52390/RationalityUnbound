# Rationality Unbound: Unraveling Humanity's Cognitive Constraints through Technology  

> When playing a game of cards, it is advantageous to build your deck and leverage its possibilities for the best outcomes. This also applies to cooperative card games, where diverse individuals can collaboratively adapt to the game at each moment, and eventually play a fully stacked deck at every turn, a game where everyone wins. The peak fitness of a species as a collective whole, where no one is left behind.

## **Nexus Series - Paper 04**

This paper focuses on how recent advancements in technology can empower cognitive capabilities, enhancing decision making and problem solving. This is just the latest step in humanity overcoming their constraints, similar to how we have had access to large amounts of additional memory and information in our pockets for the last decade or so. It is up to us how we use this new advantage.
